## Unexpected Behavior

My problme is that I'm not able to successfuly connet with airtable. At first it was a CORS issue and now i'm just getting a 401 error the says the following: xhr.js:177 GET https://api.airtable.com/v0/appYFxGlqpW0UKaDL/photology 401 (Unauthorized). I have my api key and base url that are kept inside a .env file and I restarted my server but I still haven't gotten any positive results I'm already having issues with successfuly making a form that works but if I can't render any information than it doesn't matter. 

## Expected Behavior
The expected behavior is that I can a user enters their name, email, number, and a message via a text area that gets populated at airtable with the form is submitted. 

## Reproduce the Error

> Describe the steps we can take to reproduce the error, i.e.:
Once you console.log the api function the developer tool shows the 401 error
